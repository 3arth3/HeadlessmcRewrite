# about : 
- Like other launchers, a cracked account is required to access the server, so HeadlessMC also needs one, and don't ask why.

# warning : 
- I think it's not advisable to use the jar file in this project because it's prone to any kind of risk if you use it as a bot for a Minecraft server.
- Under maintenance.

# Instructions for use:
- Run headlessmc in your terminal, download the vanilla and fabric versions you want, then press Ctrl + C.Run the command `cd headlessMc`, which will contain `config.properties`.Open it with nano and add hmc.offline.account1=your_account_name, Then save and exit the folder. Restart the jar and burn offline 1 (or another one) and play.

# Thanks :

- uid22 / 3 : Added offline functionality to allow playing Minecraft on servers using an offline account.
