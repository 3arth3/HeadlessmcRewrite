# about : 
- Like other launchers, a cracked account is required to access the server, so HeadlessMC also needs one, and don't ask why.

# warning : 
- I think it's not advisable to use the jar file in this project because it's prone to any kind of risk if you use it as a bot for a Minecraft server.

# Instructions for use:
- I'll give an example on Linux using headlessmc.
- First, you need to download the source code of this repository and check it to ensure it doesn't contain any malware. After checking, you will have a JAR file. Choose any JAR file that is compatible with your operating system.
- java -jar <name jar > (You need OpenJDK 21 to run HeadlessMC.)
- run download 1.21.1
- ctrl + c to exit the launcher
- cd /HEADLESSMC/config.properties
- nano config.properities
- input: hmc.offline.account1=name_account
- ctrl + o , ctrl + x
- cd
- java -jar <name_jar>
- on headlessmc , run offline 1
-> successful.

# Thanks :
