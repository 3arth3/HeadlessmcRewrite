# about : 
- Like other launchers, a cracked account is required to access the server, so HeadlessMC also needs one, and don't ask why.

# warning : 
- I think it's not advisable to use the jar file in this project because it's prone to any kind of risk if you use it as a bot for a Minecraft server.
- HeadlessMC has added a crack account function to help players (without a crack) escape traps (chicken lag, etc.) by using the /kill command on HeadlessMC to avoid GPU congestion.
